Hello!

Welcome to MaxCalester!
MaxCalester is a program developed by three students at Macalester College: Ibou, Lang, and Andy.
It's a restaurant recommender system based on a budget and total calorie

Here's the context:

Imagine yourself on a cool late evening. You are having a LAN party with four other friends playing Starcraft.
Suddenly, you and your group of friends get hungry. It's time for a midnight run. However, you all have strict budgets
And Want to go to a restaurant that will give you the most food or in other words - most calories.
How will you know which restaurant to go to and which items to purchase?

This is the Stomach Problem and the MaxCalester (pun intended) Program will solve this. Given a budget, the program
Will pump out which restaurants to go and which items to buy. Currently, we have five awesome restaurants:
Chipotle, Domino's, McDonalds, Subway, and Taco Bell.

To run the program, you simply need to run the MaxCalesterProgramMainProgram.
The program will incorporate the other csv files and Python files that are in this package.
Each restaurant has a corresponding csv and Python files.
You do not need to worry about the files in order to run the program.

Each csv file contains the list items from a restaurant's menu with their prices and calorie counts. They were taken from online sources, most directly from the restaurant.

The menu items' names belong to the companies.

Now, on the chance that you would like to add more restaurants to this program, you will need to
add a new csv file containing the new restaurant's data set that follows the format other csv files are in and create a new Python
file for that specific restaurant. Please refer to the existing files as references as the code will stay mostly the name. You will need to do mostly name changes and text changes.

The program features two solutions: a greedy algorithm solution and a dynamic programming solution. They are comparable in performance. 
What are you waiting for? Run the program and happy eating!

Best,

The Development Team
