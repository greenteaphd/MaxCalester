Hello!

Welcome to MaxCalester!
MaxCalester is a program developed by three students at Macalester College: Ibou, Lang, and Andy.
It's a fast-food restaurant recommender system that gives recommendations that will yield the highest total calorie count from the recommended items of the recommended restaurant
while keeping in mind a budget constraint. 

Here's the context:

Imagine yourself on a cool late evening. You are having a LAN party with four other friends and playing Starcraft.
Suddenly, you and your group of friends get hungry. It's time for a midnight run. However, you all have strict budgets
and want to go to a restaurant that will give you the most food or in other words - most calories.
How will you know which restaurant to go to and which items to purchase?

This is the Stomach Problem and the MaxCalester (pun intended) Program will solve this problem. Given a budget, the program
will pump out which restaurants to go and which items to buy. Currently, we have five awesome restaurants: Chipotle, Domino's, McDonalds, Subway, and Taco Bell.

The program features two solutions: a greedy algorithm solution and a dynamic programming solution. Either run the file titled MaxCalesterDynamicProgrammingSolution 
to run the dynamic programming solution or the MaxCalesterMainProgramGreedy file to run the greedy algorithm solution. Both are console-based interactions. They will work
without any further set up. We recommend the greedy solution for its speed, but cannot guarantee 100% accuracy. We recommend the dynamic programming solution for 100% accuracy, but cannot guarantee a quick recommendation. 

To run the greedy algorithm solution program, you simply need to run the MaxCalesterMainProgramGreedy. The program will incorporate the other csv files and Python files that are in this package.
Each restaurant has a corresponding csv and Python files. You do not need to worry about the files in order to run the program. To run the dynamic programming solution, you simply need to run
the MaxCalesterDynamicProgrammingSolution. 

Each csv file contains the list items from a restaurant's menu with their prices and calorie counts. They were taken from online sources, most directly from the restaurants.

The menu items' names belong to the companies. 

Now, on the chance that you would like to add more restaurants to this program, you will need to
add a new csv file containing the new restaurant's data set that follows the format other csv files are in. For the Greedy Solution, you will need to create a new Python
file for that specific restaurant and integrate it with the Main Program. Please refer to the existing files as references as the code will stay mostly the name. You will need to do mostly name changes and text changes.
For the Dynamic Programming Solution, you will need to add one more conditional statement that has the new restaurant csv in it. It will make sense once you read the current files. 

Have fun! What are you waiting for? Run the program and happy eating!

Best,

The Development Team
